        My name is Ethan Frerichs." I am a Junior at the <b> Unviversity of 
            Nebraska Omaha </b> . I am a very competitive person and always
            have been from day one. I enjoy video games, movies, sports,
            and reading. The book I am currently reading is called 
            <i> The Name of the Wind</i>. The Pendragon series is one of my 
            favorite book series' I have ever read. I also watch a lot of 
            Football and Basketball. My college is always the Nebraska 
            Cornhuskers. I am a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan. I also watch 
            the NBA, I follow the New Orleans Pelicans.

            I also play video games in my free time. I used to play league
            of legends a lot like over one thousand hours devoted to it.
            I played the characters Volley Bear, Wu Kong, and mostly before
            I quite I played Zed mid lane. One of my favorite games to play
            when I am stressed is stardew valley. It is a very peaceful indie
            farming game. The game I play the most right now is Super Smash
            Brothers Ultimate. I have a lot of hours invested in it as well.
            I play semi competitively and have gone to a few tournaments.
            My main is Lucina with a secondary of Joker, Pokemon Trainer
            and Ness but I am currently trying to make Joker my main.

            I also watch a lot of movies and t.v. shows. My favorite movie of
            of all time is Inception directed by Christopher Nolan. It is in
            my opinion a master piece of a movie. The cinematagrophy is
            absolutely stunning. The acting is incredible, starring Leonardo
            Decaprio, Joseph Gordan-Levitt, Ellen Page, Marian Cotillard,
            Michael Caine, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. My favorite television
            Shows are Friends, Parks and Recreation (First season except)
            , HIMYM (How I Met Your Mother), Burn Notice, and White Collar.
            I also watch a lot of anime. Some of my favorites are Fullmetal
            Alchemist Brotherhood (Way better than the original), My Hero
            Academia, Assassination Classroom, One Piece (still working
            on it 550 episodes in), and Avatar The Last Airbender (I know
            it's technically not an anime but it is so good!).
